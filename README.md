GraveYield is the **settlement layer for derelict liquidity** on Solana. When AMM pools cross all
six derelict-pool criteria — long inactivity, ≥99% price collapse, low TVL, no LP burn or lock,
and multi-epoch confirmation — anyone (the **salvor**) can permissionlessly settle the position:
remove the LP, swap the recovered tokens, and distribute the proceeds 40/40/20 to original LP
holders, the salvor, and the protocol.

GraveYield is **deterministic**, **non-custodial**, and **takes no discretion**. The salvor is a
finder under maritime salvage law, not a savior. There is no token, NFT, points programme,
airdrop, or staking layer.

## Toolchain

Pinned defaults (sources: `Anchor.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `package.json`):

| Tool       | Version          |
|------------|------------------|
| Solana CLI | 3.0.10           |
| Anchor     | 0.32.1           |
| Rust       | 1.91.1 (stable)  |
| Node       | 24 LTS           |
| pnpm       | 9                |

Run `./scripts/check-toolchain.sh` to verify your local installation.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install JS workspace deps
pnpm install

# Build Anchor programs (requires Solana 3.0.x + Anchor 0.32.x)
anchor build

# Run TypeScript typecheck across all packages
pnpm -r typecheck

# Run Rust formatting + lint checks
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Run Anchor tests (devnet localnet)
anchor test
```

## Canonical specifications

All design intent lives in [`docs/`](docs/) as markdown — this is the **living source of truth**.
The original `.docx` deliverables and the `.pdf` research paper are preserved in
[`docs/published/`](docs/published/) as immutable references for the v4.0 / v3.0 / WP-2026-001r3
publishing snapshot.

| Document | Living source | Published snapshot |

| Whitepaper v4.0 | [`docs/whitepaper.md`](docs/whitepaper.md) | `docs/published/GraveYield_Whitepaper_v4_0.docx` |
| Technical Documentation v3.0 | [`docs/technical-documentation.md`](docs/technical-documentation.md) | `docs/published/GraveYield_TechnicalDocumentation_v3_0.docx` |

## Locked invariants

These are **Charter-level prohibitions** — governance cannot raise or remove them.

- **20% protocol share is a ceiling**, not a target. Cannot be increased.
- **`lp_holder_pool_vault` is unsweepable** by any admin key, ever.
- **72h timelock** on all parameter changes; **7-day public notice** on standard upgrades.
- **Emergency upgrades** require 24h timelock and a 5-day post-mortem.
- **Squads v4 multisig** 3-of-5 at launch, scaling to 4-of-7 post-audit.
- **No token, NFT, points, airdrop, or staking** at any layer.

See [`docs/architecture/charter-invariants.md`](docs/architecture/charter-invariants.md) for the
full set.

## Terminology

GraveYield uses **maritime salvage** vocabulary deliberately. The protocol settles — it does
not save. Use these terms exclusively in code, comments, docs, PRs, commit messages, and
conversation:

- **salvage** (noun, verb) — the act of permissionlessly settling a derelict pool
- **salvor** — the actor performing the salvage (a finder under maritime law)
- **derelict pool** — an AMM pool meeting all six eligibility criteria
- `salvage_pool`, `SalvageReceipt`, `SalvageCompleted`, `PoolSalvaged`

See [`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md) for the canonical mapping.

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). All commits must be signed; `main` is protected and
requires one approving review.

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure. Phase 2 audit + Immunefi bug bounty
will activate at devnet release.
