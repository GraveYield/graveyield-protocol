# GraveYield Protocol — documentation

This directory is the **living source of truth** for GraveYield's specifications.
Every spec change lands here as a markdown PR alongside the corresponding code
change. Spec drift is treated as a bug.

## Governing specification

[`PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`](PROTOCOL_SPEC.md) is the frozen Phase 0 specification
(what makes a pool derelict, who proves it, what the protocol guarantees —
including the enforcement matrix and resolved terminology decisions). When
any document below disagrees with it, `PROTOCOL_SPEC.md` wins until a spec
PR revises both.

## Canonical spec set (locked, May 2026)

The spec set is exactly six documents. Anything claiming to be GraveYield
canon outside this list is either superseded or unrelated to the project.

## Glossary

[`glossary.md`](glossary.md) defines the canonical v4.0 vocabulary. It is the
authoritative reference for the terminology lint enforced by CI.

## Updating spec

1. Open a PR that changes both the markdown and the code in the same commit.
2. The terminology lint will fail any PR introducing forbidden words.
3. After review and merge, the next quarterly release re-renders the
   `published/` `.docx` snapshots from these markdown files. Until then,
   the markdown is the source — the docx is a frozen reference.

## What goes in `published/`

`published/` is a **snapshot directory**. Files there are versioned by name
(`v4_0.docx`, `v3_0.docx`, `WP-2026-001r3.docx`) and never edited in place.
A new minor revision lands as a new file (`v4_1.docx`, `WP-2026-001r4.docx`).
